## About
This project is designed to detect and decode barcodes from scanned documents in A4 format. It specifically works with laboratory forms containing barcodes for patient numbers and document numbers. The result of the barcode detection is returned in a JSON file and also displayed in the terminal as output.


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Installing
To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal:

python detect_barcode2.py -i "Path_to_scanned_document"

Replace "Path_to_scanned_document" with the actual path to the scanned document, which should be either a PNG or JPEG image.
